# 📚 ARQA System - Clear Overview

## 🤔 What is this?

**ARQA** = **A**rabic **Q**uestion **A**nswering System

This is a system that can:
1. 📄 **Read Arabic HTML documents** (like web pages, articles)
2. 🔍 **Search through them** to find relevant information  
3. 💬 **Answer questions** in Arabic about the content

Think of it like Google, but specifically designed for Arabic content and question answering.

## 📁 What Files Do We Actually Have?

### 🎯 **Main System Files**
```
src/arqa/               # Main ARQA package
├── simple_ingest.py    # ✅ WORKING: Processes Arabic HTML files  
├── ingest.py           # ❌ BROKEN: Advanced version (needs complex setup)
├── retriever.py        # 🔄 TODO: Will search through processed documents
├── reader.py           # 🔄 TODO: Will answer questions
└── api.py              # 🔄 TODO: Web API for the system
```

### 🧪 **Working Demo**
```
test_html_demo.py       # ✅ WORKING: Shows how the system processes HTML
```

### 📖 **Documentation**
```

## 🚀 What Actually Works Right Now?

### ✅ **Phase 1: HTML Processing (WORKING)**

The system can take Arabic HTML files and convert them into clean, searchable text:

**Input:** Arabic HTML file like this:
```html
<html>
<body>
<h1>الذكاء الاصطناعي</h1>
<p>يشهد مجال الذكاء الاصطناعي تطوراً سريعاً...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Output:** Clean JSON data like this:
```json
{
  "content": "الذكاء الاصطناعي يشهد مجال الذكاء الاصطناعي تطورا سريعا...",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "الذكاء الاصطناعي",
    "words": 106,
    "source": "ai_article.html"
  }
}
```

### 🔄 **What It Does:**
1. 📖 **Reads HTML files** and extracts the actual content (removes ads, navigation, etc.)
2. 🔤 **Cleans Arabic text** (normalizes different letter forms: أ→ا, ة→ه)
3. ✂️ **Splits into chunks** (breaks long articles into searchable pieces)
4. 💾 **Saves as structured data** (ready for search and retrieval)

## 🎮 How to Use It

### Run the Working Demo:
```powershell
python test_html_demo.py
```

This will:
1. Create sample Arabic HTML files
2. Process them through the system  
3. Show you the results
4. Save processed data to `test_output/`

## 🔧 What's Next?

The system is built in phases:

1. ✅ **Phase 1: HTML Ingestion** (DONE - working!)
2. 🔄 **Phase 2: Document Retrieval** (TODO - search functionality)  
3. 🔄 **Phase 3: Question Answering** (TODO - AI responses)
4. 🔄 **Phase 4: Web API** (TODO - web interface)

## 💡 Simple Analogy

Think of this like building a smart librarian for Arabic content:

1. 📚 **Phase 1 (DONE)**: The librarian learns to read and organize Arabic books
2. 🔍 **Phase 2 (TODO)**: The librarian learns to quickly find relevant books  
3. 🧠 **Phase 3 (TODO)**: The librarian learns to answer questions using the books
4. 🌐 **Phase 4 (TODO)**: You can talk to the librarian through a website

Right now, our librarian can read and organize Arabic books perfectly! 📖✨
